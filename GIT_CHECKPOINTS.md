# GIT CHECKPOINTS — HONESTY ERP Design Lab

These are technical/history checkpoints. They are **not** Product Owner visual
approvals unless explicitly stated.

## Live main rule

Always resolve live `origin/main` directly at session start. This file records
named checkpoints; it does not claim that its own latest docs SHA is an eternal
repository HEAD.

## Continuity protocol checkpoint

- `66abb185c3e837d9c659ed56106cf668d46103c5`
  `docs(handoff): establish persistent continuity protocol`

## Current CheckBox runtime/source

- `4c7cfe502b14cb594dfafc1043d2e14a5ecb1db8`
  `fix(check-box): move readonly click guard to native input`

This fixes the two Angular template-lint accessibility findings from the first
local V5 canonical run.

Fresh `npm run verify:clean` after this checkpoint is pending.

## Exact-reference CheckBox V5

- `4c629875fb2cb1ee3e5d9c0ae2007ed0f6d764a6`
  `fix(check-box): implement exact Product Owner reference V5`

At this checkpoint the Product Owner local `verify:clean` passed every
project governance gate through ErpConfirm, then Angular template lint stopped
on two outer-label click accessibility errors.

Visual/reference implementation itself was not changed by the subsequent
lint follow-up.

## Previous CheckBox reference evolution

Earlier CheckBox V1–V4 checkpoints are historical/superseded for visual
authority.

Current visual authority is:

`src/app/controls/check-box/CHECK_BOX_REFERENCE_EXACT_V5.md`

## Button Composites

ButtonGroup / SplitButton / FabMenu correction previously reached full
technical green before the CheckBox reference wave.

Those components are not the currently active implementation unit.

## Next checkpoint rule

Whenever a substantive code/docs/verification cycle completes:

1. add the new current/source/verification checkpoint here;
2. update `CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATE.md`;
3. synchronize the four continuity authority files;
4. clearly distinguish:
   - runtime/source checkpoint;
   - docs-only checkpoint;
   - verified technical checkpoint;
   - Product Owner visual approval checkpoint.

Do not call a docs-only HEAD a freshly verified source checkpoint unless the
underlying source was actually verified.

## 2026-10-04 — CheckBox V5 visually accepted; RadioBox design wave opened

Product Owner decision:

- current exact-reference `ErpCheckBox` V5 is visually accepted;
- `ErpRadioBox` is the next visual item and may be designed with the same
  method, visual language, and design discipline;
- native radio semantics remain authoritative;
- the RadioBox design contract is
  `src/app/controls/radio-box/RADIO_BOX_VISUAL_CONTRACT_V1.md`.

Execution boundary:

- CheckBox visual gate is closed;
- fresh canonical `npm run verify:clean` after the merged CheckBox read-only
  lint correction is still technically pending;
- RadioBox design/contract work is authorized now;
- RadioBox runtime/source implementation waits for that technical gate to pass;
- EmptyState and Select remain unopened.

Approved RadioBox direction:

- modes: `radio | tile`;
- variants: `outline | filled | soft`;
- sizes: sm 18px / md 22px / lg 28px / xl 36px, with higher shared Field
  sizes aliasing xl;
- optional description, read-only guard, and standalone visible-text
  suppression aligned to the accepted CheckBox family language;
- circular native radio indicator with centered dot;
- no switch and no indeterminate semantics;
- Tile single-select is owned by RadioBox visual mode together with RadioGroup
  coordinated single-selection semantics.

Technical green remains separate from Product Owner visual approval.

<!-- CHATGPT_RADIOBOX_IMPLEMENTED_2026_10_04_START -->
## 2026-10-04 — RadioBox accepted-family implementation completed

Product Owner authorization now includes immediate source implementation.

Implemented contract:

- `ErpRadioBoxMode = 'radio' | 'tile'`;
- `ErpRadioBoxVariant = 'outline' | 'filled' | 'soft'`;
- sm/md/lg/xl = 18/22/28/36px;
- description / readOnly / hideText;
- native radio remains the semantic/CVA owner;
- centered dot only; no SVG, switch, or indeterminate state;
- Tile single-select is implemented through RadioBox + RadioGroup;
- RadioGroup visual pass-through is bounded and preserves its existing
  string-value CVA and Arrow-key selection model.

Source/tests/showcase/governance are updated together.

Current status: **implemented / fresh canonical verification pending / Product
Owner RadioBox Light-Dark runtime and visual review pending**.

Mandatory next gate: `npm run verify:clean`.

EmptyState and Select remain closed.
