# GIT CHECKPOINTS — HONESTY ERP Design Lab

These are technical/history checkpoints. They are **not** Product Owner visual
approvals unless explicitly stated.

## Live main rule

Always resolve live `origin/main` directly at session start. This file records
named checkpoints; it does not claim that its own latest docs SHA is an eternal
repository HEAD.

## Continuity protocol checkpoint

- `66abb185c3e837d9c659ed56106cf668d46103c5`
  `docs(handoff): establish persistent continuity protocol`

## Current CheckBox runtime/source

- `4c7cfe502b14cb594dfafc1043d2e14a5ecb1db8`
  `fix(check-box): move readonly click guard to native input`

This fixes the two Angular template-lint accessibility findings from the first
local V5 canonical run.

Fresh `npm run verify:clean` after this checkpoint is pending.

## Exact-reference CheckBox V5

- `4c629875fb2cb1ee3e5d9c0ae2007ed0f6d764a6`
  `fix(check-box): implement exact Product Owner reference V5`

At this checkpoint the Product Owner local `verify:clean` passed every
project governance gate through ErpConfirm, then Angular template lint stopped
on two outer-label click accessibility errors.

Visual/reference implementation itself was not changed by the subsequent
lint follow-up.

## Previous CheckBox reference evolution

Earlier CheckBox V1–V4 checkpoints are historical/superseded for visual
authority.

Current visual authority is:

`src/app/controls/check-box/CHECK_BOX_REFERENCE_EXACT_V5.md`

## Button Composites

ButtonGroup / SplitButton / FabMenu correction previously reached full
technical green before the CheckBox reference wave.

Those components are not the currently active implementation unit.

## Next checkpoint rule

Whenever a substantive code/docs/verification cycle completes:

1. add the new current/source/verification checkpoint here;
2. update `CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATE.md`;
3. synchronize the four continuity authority files;
4. clearly distinguish:
   - runtime/source checkpoint;
   - docs-only checkpoint;
   - verified technical checkpoint;
   - Product Owner visual approval checkpoint.

Do not call a docs-only HEAD a freshly verified source checkpoint unless the
underlying source was actually verified.

## 2026-10-04 — CheckBox V5 visually accepted; RadioBox design wave opened

Product Owner decision:

- current exact-reference `ErpCheckBox` V5 is visually accepted;
- `ErpRadioBox` is the next visual item and may be designed with the same
  method, visual language, and design discipline;
- native radio semantics remain authoritative;
- the RadioBox design contract is
  `src/app/controls/radio-box/RADIO_BOX_VISUAL_CONTRACT_V1.md`.

Execution boundary:

- CheckBox visual gate is closed;
- fresh canonical `npm run verify:clean` after the merged CheckBox read-only
  lint correction is still technically pending;
- RadioBox design/contract work is authorized now;
- RadioBox runtime/source implementation waits for that technical gate to pass;
- EmptyState and Select remain unopened.

Approved RadioBox direction:

- modes: `radio | tile`;
- variants: `outline | filled | soft`;
- sizes: sm 18px / md 22px / lg 28px / xl 36px, with higher shared Field
  sizes aliasing xl;
- optional description, read-only guard, and standalone visible-text
  suppression aligned to the accepted CheckBox family language;
- circular native radio indicator with centered dot;
- no switch and no indeterminate semantics;
- Tile single-select is owned by RadioBox visual mode together with RadioGroup
  coordinated single-selection semantics.

Technical green remains separate from Product Owner visual approval.

<!-- CHATGPT_RADIOBOX_IMPLEMENTED_2026_10_04_START -->
## 2026-10-04 — RadioBox accepted-family implementation completed

Product Owner authorization now includes immediate source implementation.

Implemented contract:

- `ErpRadioBoxMode = 'radio' | 'tile'`;
- `ErpRadioBoxVariant = 'outline' | 'filled' | 'soft'`;
- sm/md/lg/xl = 18/22/28/36px;
- description / readOnly / hideText;
- native radio remains the semantic/CVA owner;
- centered dot only; no SVG, switch, or indeterminate state;
- Tile single-select is implemented through RadioBox + RadioGroup;
- RadioGroup visual pass-through is bounded and preserves its existing
  string-value CVA and Arrow-key selection model.

Source/tests/showcase/governance are updated together.

Current status: **implemented / fresh canonical verification pending / Product
Owner RadioBox Light-Dark runtime and visual review pending**.

Mandatory next gate: `npm run verify:clean`.

EmptyState and Select remain closed.

## 2026-10-04 — RadioBox canonical verification reached tests; Vitest worker contention corrected

Product Owner local verification on
`6d00e7963ca986d92f72e597d3a2ff6c8aad2fa7` established:

- `build:clean:self-test` PASS;
- standalone `build:clean` PASS with zero warnings;
- all repository governance checks PASS;
- Angular lint PASS;
- RadioBox unit tests PASS — 10/10;
- RadioGroup unit tests PASS — 6/6;
- the RadioBox Design Lab review tests that completed were PASS;
- the full test stage stopped with 13 timeout failures across eight unrelated
  suites;
- no assertion failure or RadioBox/RadioGroup functional failure was reported.

The failure distribution includes Tooltip/Overlay motion loops, App route
loading, Buttons/Icons showcases, Selection/Temporal internals, and repeated
Inputs full-page renders. This is execution-resource contention, not evidence of
one shared product/runtime defect.

Bounded tooling correction:

- add `vitest-base.config.mts`;
- configure Angular's unit-test `runnerConfig` to load it;
- cap Vitest at `maxWorkers: 4`;
- keep file parallelism enabled;
- do not raise `testTimeout`;
- do not add retries;
- do not weaken any product test, assertion, lint/governance rule, typecheck,
  style budget, or zero-warning gate.

The next mandatory gate remains:

`npm run verify:clean`

RadioBox implementation/design remains unchanged by this tooling correction.
EmptyState and Select remain unopened.

## 2026-10-04 — canonical verification reduced to two Overlay restoration assertions

Product Owner verification on
`1161b780709c5f35c0b304ed2d441a26f564aa44` confirmed the worker-budget
correction:

- the custom Vitest runner config was loaded;
- lint/governance remained fully PASS;
- the previous timeout failures disappeared;
- 88/89 test files passed;
- 692/694 tests passed;
- RadioBox 10/10 PASS;
- RadioGroup 6/6 PASS;
- InputControls 17/17 PASS including the complete RadioBox review evidence.

The two remaining failures were both in `overlay-host.spec.ts` and both had the
same assertion: the test expected restored `document.body.style.overflow` to
be the empty string, while the actual prior document state was `hidden`.

Production `ErpOverlayHost` deliberately captures and restores the previous
inline body-overflow value. It must not force the page to an empty overflow
value because another legitimate owner may have set a prior state.

Test-contract correction:

- no Overlay runtime code changed;
- the two restoration tests now establish an explicit previous sentinel
  `overflow = 'auto'`;
- they prove `auto -> hidden -> auto` for close and destroy paths;
- each test restores the external pre-test value in `finally`;
- no timeout, retry, assertion, governance, or product behavior was weakened.

Fresh mandatory gate:

`npm run verify:clean`

RadioBox remains implemented and technically pending only this rerun.
EmptyState and Select remain unopened.

## 2026-10-04 — ErpEmptyState exact-reference V1 opened and implemented

Product Owner exact reference:

`erp-empty-state.html`

SHA-256:

`935d1546f3e5d58f3b280fe30433888670d086f1a53f786a9b096ac3966ee048`

Binding contract:

`src/app/controls/empty-state/EMPTY_STATE_REFERENCE_EXACT_V1.md`

Decision:

- preserve all reference EmptyState scenarios, visual geometry, SVG
  illustrations, content regions, action hierarchy, customization, motion,
  speed/replay, and reduced-motion behavior;
- replace the reference palette entirely with Honesty ERP Semantic -> Component
  Tokens;
- standard actions use `ErpButton`;
- production text uses `ErpText`;
- App remains the only Light/Dark authority;
- EmptyState inherits RTL/LTR instead of owning a local direction API;
- dedicated review route: `/controls/empty-states`;
- dedicated governance and tests protect the exact-reference contract.

Current status: implementation candidate complete; fresh
`npm run verify:clean` pending.

`ErpSelect` remains unopened.
