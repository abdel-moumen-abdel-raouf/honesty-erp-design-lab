# Next Component Reference Batch V1

## Current transition — 2026-10-06

The four-component reference batch below is historical and completed through
the later accelerated Core and Phase A work. Phase B Data/Table is also
implemented and canonically green. Product Owner runtime/visual acceptance of
the grouped Core/Data work remains pending.

The completed Forms wave implements exactly `ErpForm`, `ErpFormSection`,
`ErpFormActions`, `ErpValidationSummary`, `ErpRepeater`, and `ErpStepper`.
The repository/template/Downloads audit found no external reference for any of
the six, so the Product Owner accelerated no-external-reference waiver applied
to those owners only. The batch passed canonical technical verification at
117/117 test files and 792/792 tests. The next action is grouped Product Owner
runtime/Light/Dark review. Phase 6 subsequently implemented exactly
`ErpStandardEntityForm`, `ErpEntitySchemaFields`,
`ErpEntityCustomFieldOutlet`, and `ErpEntityCustomSectionOutlet` under its
scoped no-reference waiver and passed 121/121 test files and 809/809 tests.
The current review gate includes `/controls/entity-form-batch`; Phase 7, Shell,
and all higher/unlisted families remain unopened. Technical PASS is not visual
approval.

## Historical Product Owner decision — superseded execution order

The Product Owner supplied `erp-component-templates.zip` as the visual
reference package for the next component phase and selected execution option A.

Execution order is fixed as:

1. `ErpCheckBox`
2. `ErpRadioBox`
3. `ErpEmptyState`
4. `ErpSelect`

This order is subordinate to the global bottom-up dependency law: do not open
the next item while the current item still has unresolved technical/runtime/
visual Product Owner findings.

## Reference files

- `ErpCheckBox` -> `erp-checkbox.html`
- `ErpRadioBox` -> `erp-radiobox.html`
- `ErpEmptyState` -> `erp-empty-state.html`
- `ErpSelect` -> `erp-select.html`

## Reference scope law

The Product Owner explicitly approved these files for **design reference**.

Adopt as applicable:

- component structure;
- visual proportions;
- geometry;
- spacing;
- state composition;
- interaction presentation;
- title/description hierarchy;
- open/closed/selected/disabled/focus behavior where the component requires it.

Do **not** copy reference palette values.

Honesty ERP remains authoritative for:

- Semantic Colors;
- Component Color Tokens;
- Light/Dark resolution;
- status/tone colors;
- focus colors;
- disabled colors;
- any other theme-dependent value.

No hardcoded reference palette may become production authority.

## One-component-at-a-time execution

Each component is a separate correction/implementation wave:

1. analyze current source + reference + dependencies;
2. record adopt/adapt/reject decisions;
3. update contracts/tokens/runtime/showcase/tests/governance as one unit;
4. run focused gates;
5. run `npm run verify:clean`;
6. Product Owner performs runtime/visual Light/Dark review;
7. only then may the next component be opened.

## Historical current item — superseded

`ErpCheckBox` is visually accepted. `ErpRadioBox` is the currently opened item.

Its current detailed contract is:

`src/app/controls/check-box/CHECK_BOX_REFERENCE_EXACT_V5.md`

The earlier `CHECK_BOX_REFERENCE_CORRECTION_V1.md` is historical only.

`ErpRadioBox` source changes are now authorized and implemented in the current wave. `ErpEmptyState` and `ErpSelect` remain unauthorized for source changes.

## ErpSelect boundary

The Product Owner has identified `ErpSelect` as the fourth component in this
batch. Before its source implementation begins, the current
ItemPicker/ComboBox/SearchBox selection architecture must be reconciled against
the supplied Select reference so the new Select contract does not duplicate or
silently contradict existing approved selection roles.


## CheckBox V1 visual rejection / V2 current state

The Product Owner rejected the first CheckBox reference correction after live
runtime review. Technical green did not establish visual conformance.

The first implementation was too conservative: it kept the previous CheckBox
visual skeleton and treated the supplied template as general inspiration.

That interpretation is superseded.

Current CheckBox V2 uses the supplied Classic CheckBox visual assembly directly
for geometry and interaction presentation while retaining Honesty ERP
color/token authority.

RadioBox remains unopened and unchanged until CheckBox V2 receives technical
and Product Owner visual acceptance.


## CheckBox V3 current state

Product Owner review of V2 added two corrections:

- remove selected gradients and use one resolved system tone;
- implement the template's own Classic / Switch / Neon variant vocabulary.

This is now implemented in the current CheckBox wave.

The template's Selectable Tiles and Task List remain separately classified
composition examples because the template itself does not expose them in its
Variant selector.

RadioBox remains unopened.


## Pre-handoff consistency gate

After a CheckBox V3 governance false-positive caused by stale private-variable
names in the checker, this batch adds a mandatory pre-handoff static gate.

Before any future component checkpoint is handed to Product Owner for local
execution:

- changed governance predicates must be evaluated against the actual current
  production source;
- changed tests must be checked for stale selectors/literals/contracts;
- source/governance static mismatch count must be zero;
- the full diff must remain bounded to the current component wave.

Local `npm run verify:clean` remains the canonical executable gate.


## CheckBox V4 — video-derived closure candidate

Product Owner video review reopened CheckBox after V3 and produced a bounded V4
correction before RadioBox may begin.

V4 covers:

- ordinary system selected tone instead of inverse neutral;
- visible Switch OFF track in Light and Dark;
- user activation exits indeterminate state;
- required danger derives from validation and recovers after selection;
- one disabled attenuation path;
- exact four reference size geometries;
- dedicated Size / States / Switch / Neon / Selectable Tiles /
  Select All & Task List review evidence;
- removal of forced equal-height review-card whitespace.

Pre-handoff static source/governance audit for V4: **85/85 PASS**.

RadioBox remains unopened until V4 is canonically green and visually accepted.


## CheckBox V4 merged checkpoint

The video-derived CheckBox V4 correction was squash-merged to `main` as:

`9aa72e456b902530aab61e6c5a3286d2180b9e07`.

Final post-split pre-merge static audit:

- 139 predicates checked;
- 139 PASS;
- 0 mismatches.

Fresh local executable verification and Product Owner Light/Dark visual
re-review remain pending. RadioBox remains closed.


## CheckBox V5 — erp-checkbox-3 exact-reference authority

Product Owner rejected the V4 result and supplied a replacement authoritative
file:

`erp-checkbox-3.html`

Binding implementation rule:

- reproduce the reusable component's structure, geometry, modes, variants,
  states, and motion presentation from that file;
- replace only its literal palette with Honesty ERP Semantic/Component colors;
- do not carry forward V1-V4 Neon/Classic assumptions that are absent from the
  new file.

Current CheckBox contract:

- modes: `checkbox | switch | tile`;
- variants: `outline | filled | soft`;
- sizes: sm 18px / md 22px / lg 28px / xl 36px;
- standalone visible-text suppression with accessible label preservation;
- read-only guard;
- SVG stroke check/dash;
- Switch sweep + derived thumb travel;
- production Tile mode;
- indeterminate/select-all behavior;
- exact state matrix.

The source's single-select Tile subsection uses native radio inputs and is
therefore reserved for the next RadioBox wave rather than being faked with
checkbox semantics.

RadioBox remains otherwise unopened.

<!-- CHATGPT_RADIOBOX_DESIGN_OPEN_2026_10_04_START -->
## 2026-10-04 — CheckBox V5 visually accepted; RadioBox design wave opened

Product Owner decision:

- current exact-reference `ErpCheckBox` V5 is visually accepted;
- `ErpRadioBox` is the next visual item and may be designed with the same
  method, visual language, and design discipline;
- native radio semantics remain authoritative;
- the RadioBox design contract is
  `src/app/controls/radio-box/RADIO_BOX_VISUAL_CONTRACT_V1.md`.

Execution boundary:

- CheckBox visual gate is closed;
- fresh canonical `npm run verify:clean` after the merged CheckBox read-only
  lint correction is still technically pending;
- RadioBox design/contract work is authorized now;
- RadioBox runtime/source implementation waits for that technical gate to pass;
- EmptyState and Select remain unopened.

Approved RadioBox direction:

- modes: `radio | tile`;
- variants: `outline | filled | soft`;
- sizes: sm 18px / md 22px / lg 28px / xl 36px, with higher shared Field
  sizes aliasing xl;
- optional description, read-only guard, and standalone visible-text
  suppression aligned to the accepted CheckBox family language;
- circular native radio indicator with centered dot;
- no switch and no indeterminate semantics;
- Tile single-select is owned by RadioBox visual mode together with RadioGroup
  coordinated single-selection semantics.

Technical green remains separate from Product Owner visual approval.

<!-- CHATGPT_RADIOBOX_IMPLEMENTED_2026_10_04_START -->
## 2026-10-04 — RadioBox accepted-family implementation completed

Product Owner authorization now includes immediate source implementation.

Implemented contract:

- `ErpRadioBoxMode = 'radio' | 'tile'`;
- `ErpRadioBoxVariant = 'outline' | 'filled' | 'soft'`;
- sm/md/lg/xl = 18/22/28/36px;
- description / readOnly / hideText;
- native radio remains the semantic/CVA owner;
- centered dot only; no SVG, switch, or indeterminate state;
- Tile single-select is implemented through RadioBox + RadioGroup;
- RadioGroup visual pass-through is bounded and preserves its existing
  string-value CVA and Arrow-key selection model.

Source/tests/showcase/governance are updated together.

Current status: **implemented / fresh canonical verification pending / Product
Owner RadioBox Light-Dark runtime and visual review pending**.

Mandatory next gate: `npm run verify:clean`.

EmptyState and Select remain closed.

## 2026-10-04 — ErpEmptyState exact-reference V1 opened and implemented

Product Owner exact reference:

`erp-empty-state.html`

SHA-256:

`935d1546f3e5d58f3b280fe30433888670d086f1a53f786a9b096ac3966ee048`

Binding contract:

`src/app/controls/empty-state/EMPTY_STATE_REFERENCE_EXACT_V1.md`

Decision:

- preserve all reference EmptyState scenarios, visual geometry, SVG
  illustrations, content regions, action hierarchy, customization, motion,
  speed/replay, and reduced-motion behavior;
- replace the reference palette entirely with Honesty ERP Semantic -> Component
  Tokens;
- standard actions use `ErpButton`;
- production text uses `ErpText`;
- App remains the only Light/Dark authority;
- EmptyState inherits RTL/LTR instead of owning a local direction API;
- dedicated review route: `/controls/empty-states`;
- dedicated governance and tests protect the exact-reference contract.

Current status: implementation candidate complete; fresh
`npm run verify:clean` pending.

`ErpSelect` remains unopened.

<!-- CHATGPT_EMPTY_STATE_FULLY_GREEN_2026_10_05_START -->
## 2026-10-05 — ErpEmptyState canonical verification is Fully Green

Canonical verification was run from the current EmptyState checkpoint after the
projection-directive lint correction.

The first complete run established:

- all governance checks PASS;
- Angular lint PASS;
- 91/91 test files PASS;
- 710/710 tests PASS;
- `typecheck:app` PASS;
- `typecheck:spec` PASS;
- production compilation completed;
- the zero-warning gate detected one component-style budget warning only:
  `empty-state.scss` was 4.34 kB, 341 bytes above the unchanged 4.00 kB
  warning threshold.

The warning was corrected without changing selectors, values, APIs, tokens,
visual behavior, tests, budgets, timeouts, or retries:

- existing Title/Description/Actions/Extra rules moved verbatim from
  `empty-state.scss` into `empty-state-content.scss`;
- the new style file is loaded immediately after the base style;
- EmptyState governance now includes the split style in the same production
  visual contract.

A fresh complete `npm run verify:clean` then passed:

- all governance checks PASS;
- Angular lint PASS;
- 91/91 test files PASS;
- 710/710 tests PASS;
- `typecheck:app` PASS;
- `typecheck:spec` PASS;
- production build PASS;
- initial production bundle: 373.68 kB;
- `Zero-warning build gate: PASS`;
- Angular warnings: 0.

Current product state:

- `ErpEmptyState` is a Fully Green technical candidate;
- this does not equal Product Owner visual approval;
- the immediate gate is Product Owner runtime/Light/Dark review of
  `ErpEmptyState`;
- `ErpSelect` remains unopened and no Selection-family implementation is
  authorized.

<!-- CHATGPT_EMPTY_STATE_LOTTIE_MIGRATION_2026_10_05_START -->
## EmptyState Product Owner Lottie migration — 2026-10-05

Starting checkpoint: `fb4b392071968800b1286c5c2ce824b173a50b0d`.

The Product Owner superseded the five default SVG compositions with supplied
Lottie artwork. The binding mapping is `no-data -> no-data.json`, `no-search ->
no-search.json`, `error -> error.json`, `forbidden -> forbidden.json`, and
`custom -> custom.json` under `public/lottie/empty-state/`. At that migration
checkpoint, `no-search` retained its asset while defaulting Illustration to
hidden; that historical default is superseded by the Product Owner decision
recorded below. Consumer `erpEmptyStateIllustration` projection still overrides
the default artwork.

The five source files were inspected before import. They contain no external
asset references. Only `general-analytics-animation.json` contained an explicit
white full-canvas `background Outlines` artwork layer; that layer alone was
removed from the project `custom.json` copy. The Downloads originals were not
modified. The other four project copies required no background-layer removal.
Embedded no-search PNG assets preserve alpha transparency.

`lottie-web` `5.13.0` is the sole added runtime and is MIT-licensed. Its local
SVG-only player is copied by the Angular asset pipeline and loaded lazily by an
EmptyState-internal implementation helper; there is no CDN, absolute local
path, or new public Lottie component family. The renderer uses
`xMidYMid meet`, centered `clamp(5.5rem, 16vw, 8.25rem)` bounds, no crop,
stretch, overflow, or CSS artwork background.

Existing EmptyState animation API remains intact. `motionSpeed` calls the
Lottie runtime speed API; `animated=false`, `illustrationMotion='none'`, and
runtime reduced-motion all hold a static first frame. `replayEntrance()` also
rewinds and replays Lottie when motion is allowed. Media-query changes are
observed, and variant replacement/component destruction destroy the previous
AnimationItem so instances cannot overlap or leak. Lottie artwork colors are
Product Owner asset-owned for this wave; component chrome remains governed by
Semantic and EmptyState Component Tokens.

Obsolete default SVG markup, SVG-only tokens, and dead illustration motion
styles were removed. EmptyState governance now verifies assets, exact mapping,
local runtime loading, transparency/background restrictions, speed, replay,
reduced-motion handling, and lifecycle cleanup. Its self-test rejects missing
mapping, Downloads paths, missing destroy/reduced-motion/speed handling, and a
full-canvas background. Entrance-keyframe validation is whitespace-insensitive.

Technical verification is fully green: EmptyState governance self-test PASS;
EmptyState governance PASS; lint/governance PASS; 92/92 test files and 721/721
tests PASS; app/spec typechecks PASS; production build PASS at 373.68 kB initial
with zero Angular warnings; `npm run verify:clean` PASS.

This technical result does not equal Product Owner visual approval. The
immediate gate is Product Owner runtime Light/Dark review of all five Lottie
scenarios, responsive sizing, transparency, motion speeds, replay, and reduced
motion. `ErpSelect` remains unopened, and no Selection Family, ItemPicker,
ComboBox, or SearchBox work is authorized by this wave.

Commit scope: `feat(controls): adopt lottie empty-state illustrations`.
<!-- CHATGPT_EMPTY_STATE_LOTTIE_MIGRATION_2026_10_05_END -->

<!-- CHATGPT_EMPTY_STATE_LOTTIE_RUNTIME_REPAIR_2026_10_05_START -->
## 2026-10-05 — EmptyState Lottie runtime visibility repaired

Product Owner runtime review proved that the first Lottie migration was
technically green while every default illustration remained invisible. The
captured browser exception came from the manual runtime script error handler,
before `window.lottie`, `loadAnimation()`, JSON loading, `DOMLoaded`, or SVG
injection. The previous unit tests replaced the loader with a mock and therefore
did not prove real runtime delivery or rendered DOM output.

Repository diagnosis found the packaged
`node_modules/lottie-web/build/player/lottie_svg.min.js` file present. Before
the correction, the local dev URL `/vendor/lottie-web/lottie_svg.min.js`
returned HTTP 200 with `text/javascript` and real JavaScript, while every
Lottie JSON URL returned HTTP 200 with `application/json` and valid JSON. This
does not negate the Product Owner environment's script-load failure; it proves
that the copied-asset plus injected-global chain was environment-sensitive
rather than a damaged five-asset set.

The correction removes the copied runtime asset, manual `<script>` injection,
and all `window.lottie` dependency. EmptyState now lazy-imports the packaged
SVG-only ESM build through the Angular bundler, explicitly fetches and validates
each JSON response, passes `animationData` to Lottie, and exposes internal
`loading | ready | static | error` evidence. `ready` or `static` is reached
only after `DOMLoaded` and a generated SVG are both present. Runtime import,
HTTP/JSON, `loadAnimation`, `data_failed`, `error`, and missing-SVG failures
are surfaced through Angular's ErrorHandler instead of failing silently.
Animation listeners and the AnimationItem are cleaned up on replacement and
destruction.

Browser runtime evidence on `/controls/empty-states` confirms generated SVG
output for `no-data`, explicitly enabled `no-search`, `error`, `forbidden`,
and `custom`. The scenario matrix keeps all five visible as static evidence.
`float` and `pulse` remain visible and playing; `none` and
`animated=false` remain visible on a static first frame; Replay returns the
allowed animation to playing state. Browser-emulated
`prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` produced six visible generated SVGs in static
state with no playback. The approved responsive clamp is unchanged.

Final technical verification for this correction: EmptyState governance
self-test PASS; EmptyState governance PASS; 92/92 test files and 728/728 tests
PASS; lint/governance PASS; app/spec typechecks PASS; production build PASS at
373.68 kB initial with zero Angular warnings; `npm run verify:clean` PASS.

This technical pass does not equal Product Owner visual approval. The immediate
gate remains Product Owner runtime Light/Dark review of EmptyState Lottie
visibility, artwork, responsive sizing, motion, replay, and reduced motion.
`ErpSelect` remains unopened; Selection Family, ItemPicker, ComboBox, and
SearchBox were not modified.

<!-- CHATGPT_EMPTY_STATE_NO_SEARCH_DEFAULT_VISIBLE_2026_10_05_START -->
## 2026-10-05 — no-search illustration default superseded

Product Owner superseded the original `no-search` hidden-illustration behavior.
The `no-search` Lottie is now visible by default, so all five EmptyState
scenarios default to visible illustrations. The exact asset mapping remains
`no-search -> /lottie/empty-state/no-search.json`; the ordinary explicit
`showIllustration=false` override remains supported.

The redundant Scenario Matrix `showIllustration=true` override was removed so
the review evidence now exercises the real scenario default. Unit tests prove
the default Lottie and explicit hide override; showcase tests prove the exact
asset; governance rejects a restored hidden default. Browser runtime evidence
confirmed immediate generated SVG output for `no-search`, playing `float` and
`pulse`, visible static `none`, and continued visibility in Light and Dark.

The Lottie runtime, dynamic import, fetch/readiness pipeline, reduced-motion,
lifecycle, sizing, speed, Replay, and JSON assets were not changed. 92/92 test
files and 728/728 tests passed; `npm run verify:clean` passed with zero Angular
warnings. Technical green does not equal Product Owner visual approval.
`ErpSelect` remains unopened.

<!-- CHATGPT_EMPTY_STATE_LOTTIE_SIZE_2026_10_05_START -->
## 2026-10-05 — EmptyState Lottie illustration size enlarged

Product Owner runtime review found that all five Lottie illustrations were
visible and functional but relatively small. The shared responsive illustration
bounds now supersede `clamp(5.5rem, 16vw, 8.25rem)` with
`clamp(6.75rem, 20vw, 10rem)` for `no-data`, `no-search`, `error`,
`forbidden`, and `custom`. This is one size-contract correction only; the
runtime loader, JSON assets, variant mapping, reduced-motion, replay,
`motionSpeed`, lifecycle cleanup, text, actions, and colors are unchanged.

Runtime evidence covered all 20 combinations of five variants, Light/Dark, and
desktop/narrow viewports. Every specimen reached `ready`, injected an SVG with
`preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet"`, stayed centered, preserved a 24px gap
to the title, and produced no page or stage horizontal overflow. The resolved
box was 160px square on desktop and 108px square at the narrow viewport.
`float` and `pulse` remained animated; `none`, `animated=false`, and a
page initialized with reduced motion retained a visible static SVG frame.
Replay remained ready and visible.

The bounded governance self-test and checker passed, 92/92 test files and
728/728 tests passed, and `npm run verify:clean` passed with zero warnings.
Technical green does not equal Product Owner visual approval. `ErpSelect`
remains unopened; the immediate gate remains Product Owner runtime/visual
review of the enlarged EmptyState illustrations.

<!-- CHATGPT_ACCELERATED_CORE_BATCH_2026_10_05_BEGIN -->
## 2026-10-05 — Accelerated Multi-Component Wave

The Product Owner temporarily accepts the current ErpEmptyState result for accelerated continuation; this is not a visual freeze or final approval. The Product Owner explicitly opened one grouped-review wave for ErpSelect, ErpStatusBadge, ErpAlert, ErpSkeleton, ErpAvatar, ErpTabs, ErpTable, and ErpPagination. Technical checks occur per component, while Product Owner runtime/visual review is deferred to the completed group. Technical green remains distinct from visual acceptance, and later findings may reopen any component. Forms, SmartTable, Shell, and all unlisted component families remain unopened.

ErpSelect uses the supplied erp-select.html visual authority and remains distinct from ComboBox, SearchBox, and ItemPicker ownership. The other seven components are implemented under the Product Owner accelerated-wave no-external-reference waiver and reuse the existing Honesty ERP visual language.
<!-- CHATGPT_ACCELERATED_CORE_BATCH_2026_10_05_END -->

- `typecheck:app`: PASS.
- `typecheck:spec`: PASS.
- Production build: PASS; initial bundle 374.07 kB; zero warnings.
- Grouped Product Owner review remains pending at `/controls/core-batch`.


<!-- ACCELERATED_PHASE_A_HARDENING_2026_10_05_START -->
## 2026-10-05 — Accelerated Phase A hardening complete

The Product Owner authorized a connected two-phase cycle. Phase A hardened the
existing accelerated core batch before any data/table component was opened.

Closed findings:

- ErpSelect now has real coverage for five sizes, single/multiple normalization,
  disabled options, max selection, search/group filtering, all sort modes,
  keyboard/open/close/clear behavior, disabled state, and CVA publication;
- the Product Owner Select reference is recorded as `erp-select.html`,
  SHA-256 `5A31FC10A3D1208BF64E35EB5139823E48F8E2BF1D0190D07DD5DB5DBC4DF23B`;
- Pagination uses the Foundation Query API and one normalized page/count source;
- Tabs consumes its own disabled-foreground Component Token and supports keyed
  rich panel templates;
- Avatar image failure is scoped to the failing source;
- Skeleton line count normalizes to an integer of at least one;
- Table supports keyed rich-cell templates and documents controlled
  `selectedKeys` plus intent-only `rowActivated`;
- broad selector lint suppressions were replaced by line-scoped exceptions;
- StatusBadge remains noninteractive and creates no automatic live region.

Canonical Phase A verification:

- `npm run verify:clean`: PASS;
- lint/governance: PASS;
- tests: 101/101 files and 758/758 tests PASS;
- `typecheck:app`: PASS;
- `typecheck:spec`: PASS;
- production build: PASS, initial bundle 374.08 kB, zero Angular warnings.

The Product Owner explicitly authorizes immediate Phase B implementation of
exactly SortHeader, ColumnChooser, FilterBar, FilterDrawer, TableToolbar,
BulkActionBar, ViewSwitcher, and SmartTable. Product Owner visual review remains
grouped until the connected cycle is complete. Forms and Shell remain unopened.
Technical green does not equal visual acceptance.

<!-- ACCELERATED_PHASE_B_DATA_TABLE_2026_10_05_START -->
## 2026-10-05 — Accelerated Phase B data/table batch complete

Phase B implemented exactly ErpSortHeader, ErpColumnChooser, ErpFilterBar,
ErpFilterDrawer, ErpTableToolbar, ErpBulkActionBar, ErpViewSwitcher, and
ErpSmartTable. The pre-implementation reference audit found no external visual
reference for any of the eight after checking repository source/docs, Product
Owner template locations, Downloads, and the available template archive. All
eight therefore use the explicit Product Owner accelerated-wave
no-external-reference waiver and the existing Honesty ERP visual language.

The data/table boundary is now explicit:

- ErpTable remains the semantic rendering gateway and owns the single keyed
  rich-cell template contract;
- ErpSmartTable orchestrates the approved lower controls and owns local
  sort/filter/page behavior or revisioned remote query intents only;
- remote data loading, stale-response policy, transport, permissions, and
  business actions remain outside SmartTable;
- FilterDrawer stages typed filters in the shared OverlayFrame;
- loading, empty, and error presentation reuse ErpSkeleton, ErpEmptyState, and
  ErpAlert;
- all eight visual components own isolated Component Token modules, bringing
  the repository total to 63 concrete modules;
- long-lived governance rejects HTTP ownership, missing lower-owner
  composition, raw routed table authoring, a duplicate cell renderer, and
  missing token bases; its self-test passes.

Canonical Phase B verification:

- npm run verify:clean: PASS;
- lint/governance: PASS;
- tests: 110/110 files and 778/778 tests PASS;
- typecheck:app: PASS;
- typecheck:spec: PASS;
- production build: PASS, initial bundle 374.44 kB / estimated transfer
  85.38 kB, zero Angular warnings.

The combined technical review routes are /controls/core-batch and
/controls/data-batch. Product Owner grouped runtime/visual review remains
pending for both batches. Technical green does not equal visual acceptance and
later findings may reopen any component. Forms, Shell, and every unlisted
future component remain unopened.
