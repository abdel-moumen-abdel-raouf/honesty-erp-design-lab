## Repository

GitHub: `abdel-moumen-abdel-raouf/honesty-erp-design-lab`

Owner local workspace:

`C:\Users\Misrtech\Sources\WEBSITES\honesty-erp-design-lab`

Branch:

`main`

## Current state

The expanded Inputs correction and unified validation program is now implemented
in source/tests/governance on current `main`.

Current implementation checkpoint:
`c3971739198e61adff98d821a6b8f6775faa4e6c`

Implemented in this program:
- common ERP input semantic state:
  `null | empty | no-selection | invalid-entry | valid-entry`;
- common `valid`, `errors`, `validationIssues`, and validation snapshot;
- common `required` and external/server validation issue hook;
- Angular Forms Validator bridge from the same validation source of truth;
- exactly one `NG_VALIDATORS` provider required for every CVA ERP input;
- validation changes from non-committed drafts notify Angular Forms;
- Field-family `clearable` defaults on with per-instance opt-out;
- text/domain validation is non-destructive;
- URL/Tel keep invalid user text visible and publish domain errors;
- Number/Money/NumberStepper keep invalid drafts visible and publish
  format/min/max/step errors rather than silently clamping editable input;
- text-like max length is validation-only and does not truncate/block typing;
- File/Image expose min/max count, type, size, and rejected-attempt issues through
  the common errors contract;
- Ghost/Text/Underline have token-owned hover discoverability;
- RangeSlider uses one global coordinate domain for both native thumbs and rail;
- RangeSlider rail and Tooltip anchors share thumb-center geometry;
- active thumb Tooltip value is customizable and requests repositioning while
  the thumb moves;
- RangeSlider validation projects to danger state, aria-invalid, and visible
  feedback;
- Time/DateTime Now updates staged value and reveals selected hour/minute;
- DateRange uses rolling inclusive presets:
  آخر 7 أيام / 7 أيام بدءًا من اليوم / آخر 30 يومًا /
  30 يومًا بدءًا من اليوم;
- Date/Time/DateTime/DateRange expose common bounds/state validation;
- ColorPicker is instance-fixed to `system | free` and no longer has an
  internal mode switch;
- ItemPicker remains select-like while ComboBox remains editable type-to-filter;
- Design Lab evidence differentiates those contracts;
- governance self-tests protect the new validation, hover, RangeSlider,
  temporal, selection, SearchBox, and Angular-validator contracts.

Important verification distinction:
- current source is **implemented / verification pending**;
- do not call it Fully Green until a fresh complete `npm run verify:clean`
  passes from current `main`;
- Product Owner runtime/Light/Dark re-review is still required after technical
  green.

Latest prior Fully Green baseline remains:
`50ae8e5f9f9cc537435217a644548c10bd097ecb`

Read `NEW_CHAT_HANDOFF.md` for the exact continuation state.


<!-- CHATGPT_CONTINUITY_SYNC_START -->
## 2026-09-30 — ChatGPT continuity sync

Live GitHub `main` was re-read and externally synchronized from:
`a28a0fffa01ea1035d0dce47910922b30d8f06c0`
(`docs(inputs): record expanded implementation checkpoint`).

Latest bounded Inputs implementation checkpoint under that head:
`c3971739198e61adff98d821a6b8f6775faa4e6c`.

Current continuation state:
- expanded Inputs corrections + unified validation are implemented in source/tests/governance;
- current source is still **verification pending**;
- Inputs remains Product Owner **BLOCKED** until technical verification and runtime/Light/Dark re-review;
- exact next technical gate is a fresh full `npm run verify:clean` from current `main`;
- only demonstrated verification failures may reopen implementation;
- after technical green, Product Owner runtime/Light/Dark Inputs review is the next product gate;
- the no-iframe single-document App shell is already implemented and must not regress.

This synchronization is documentation/state only; it makes no runtime or visual
approval claim.

Continuity rule for subsequent project turns: update the applicable persistent
handoff/review/roadmap documents whenever the turn changes a decision, scope,
implementation state, blocker, verification result, or Product Owner finding.

## 2026-10-01 — latest Inputs verification rerun: one URL-regex lint escape corrected

Product Owner pulled and verified source at:
`dc63c08ea88e29c5fb4d78743761325b9c4a9c63`
and ran the complete canonical gate:
`npm run verify:clean`.

Observed progress:
- Single App theme authority PASS;
- routed-page ERP-only authoring PASS;
- Component Token framework PASS;
- system-color registry PASS;
- ErpText PASS;
- ErpIcon PASS;
- ErpButton PASS;
- ErpTooltip PASS;
- ErpField PASS;
- ErpOverlay PASS;
- Angular lint then stopped on exactly one ESLint error.

Exact failure:
`src/app/controls/input-family/domain-validation.ts:72:37`
`no-useless-escape`

The progressive URL character-class regex escaped a terminal hyphen even though
that position does not require escaping.

Bounded correction:
- `9315691c9579a324990a56d928e4e22d504111a4`
  `fix(inputs): remove redundant URL regex escape`;
- only the redundant escape was removed;
- runtime URL admission semantics are unchanged.

Pre-rerun checks after correction:
- zero remaining escaped-hyphen occurrences in the domain-validation source;
- ErpField governance JavaScript syntax compilation PASS;
- complete ErpField governance internal self-test PASS;
- direct URL semantic smoke check confirms required forms such as
  `example.com`, `www.example.com`, HTTP/HTTPS variants, `.org`, `.net`,
  and `.ai` are valid while `http://www.s`, `example.c`, and `localhost`
  remain invalid.

Current status:
**implemented / canonical verification pending**.

Mandatory next gate:
`npm run verify:clean`

Inputs remains Product Owner BLOCKED pending a fresh technical green result and
runtime/visual acceptance.
<!-- CHATGPT_LOCAL_VERIFY_SYNC_END -->


<!-- CHATGPT_MANDATORY_CONTINUITY_QUARTET_START -->
## 2026-10-01 — Mandatory continuity quartet + latest Fully Green checkpoint

### Mandatory synchronization rule

For every substantive project turn that changes any of the following:
- Product Owner finding or decision;
- implementation scope or completed correction;
- blocker / unblocked state;
- verification result;
- next execution gate;
- review status or acceptance status;

ChatGPT must update **all four** of these files in the same work cycle before
declaring the turn complete:

1. `src/app/controls/CONTROLS_EXECUTION_ROADMAP_V1.md`
2. `src/app/controls/INPUTS_PRODUCT_OWNER_REVIEW_FINDINGS_V1.md`
3. `README_FIRST.md`
4. `NEW_CHAT_HANDOFF.md`

Updating only a subset is not sufficient. These four documents are the required
continuity quartet for preserving current execution state and new-chat context.

### Latest canonical technical verification

Product Owner pulled and verified:
`ff4f721f600490414085e49d9c1975d640fdbbbc`
(`docs(review): synchronize URL regex lint follow-up`).

Canonical command:
`npm run verify:clean`

Result: **FULLY GREEN**.

Verified evidence:
- all repository governance checks PASS;
- Angular lint PASS;
- 87/87 test files PASS;
- 653/653 tests PASS;
- `typecheck:app` PASS;
- `typecheck:spec` PASS;
- production build PASS;
- `Zero-warning build gate: PASS`.

Current Inputs state:
- technical verification is green for the latest URL/Solid/NumberBox/File-Image
  motion/live-data correction set;
- exact next gate is Product Owner runtime re-test of those findings;
- Inputs remains Product Owner BLOCKED until explicit runtime/visual acceptance;
- no unrelated implementation is authorized.
<!-- CHATGPT_MANDATORY_CONTINUITY_QUARTET_END -->


<!-- CHATGPT_PROJECT_HISTORY_DIGEST_START -->
## Consolidated project-history digest — through 2026-10-01

This section is the compact continuity timeline for the substantive stages that
must survive chat boundaries. It complements detailed local sections elsewhere
in this repository.

### 1. No-iframe single-document Lab shell — completed

Key implementation checkpoints:
- `9471a1d5b05a5f49c767b26e3a36b6b640715e0`
  `refactor(lab): remove iframe preview architecture`
- `d703ef0c8f47264902ca55b902c1488f99b56bf9`
  `style(lab): normalize direct shell markup`

Frozen current law:
- one direct `router-outlet`;
- no preview iframe;
- no embedded/direct dual rendering;
- no `labPreview` query;
- no iframe theme propagation;
- browser viewport is the real responsive authority;
- screenshot capture remains same-document from `#lab-capture-root`;
- exactly one App-level `[attr.data-theme]="theme()"`;
- exactly one App-level `ErpOverlayHost`.

The old Desktop/Tablet/Mobile preview controls were removed because a resized
same-document container cannot honestly simulate viewport media queries.

### 2. Tooltip system — completed before active Inputs work

Important checkpoints:
- positioning contract: `7a0a14f090ee38df3ea4adc02255856d89b6c71a`;
- stale iframe-era overlay governance correction:
  `a40ea25011cd19b8e6db9945ef80f6796a9c6c0c`;
- lint correction: `3eb993e64616362bf920284e37b5005d412fd531`;
- cross-axis correction:
  `632f45a5fb7b42eefa09da0d2c8a20c0f520244b`;
- popover-padding coordinate-origin correction:
  `84d5fd91daf3fb3085cde422c186dfcf3e1ff8d0`.

Product Owner changed the default Tooltip motion to Zoom enter + Zoom exit.
Tooltip is not the active workstream.

### 3. Inputs Product Owner review — initial implementation stage

Authoritative findings:
`src/app/controls/INPUTS_PRODUCT_OWNER_REVIEW_FINDINGS_V1.md`.

Initial implementation checkpoint:
- `6daf7af7f023ad758198ce6d5eacbb5f22dd9277`.

The review established, among other points:
- SearchBox developer-selectable `modal | dropdown | inline` modes;
- functional selectable/filterable results;
- transient query distinct from committed selection;
- anchored dropdown width equal to field subject to viewport clamp;
- explicit close and no invisible/ghost hit target;
- modal vs listbox semantics;
- Time/DateTime Now;
- rolling DateRange actions;
- Confirm disabled until staged selection is valid;
- full-width Inputs Lab review;
- Arabic-first temporal empty-state copy.

Follow-up SearchBox/selection checkpoints:
- `cf91967291961037dd7f35d0e825fc4fb2da8312`;
- `92840de9c670edd32b05c1485f50c2e61e68fead`;
- `72fa7821030e2ced6ec44f6d8eaf0d2b3b2939d2`.

### 4. SearchBox invisible-hit root cause — fixed

Defensive lifecycle checkpoints:
- `d274bdd2697d4d808f029bb1892ac0ee7591b589`;
- `4ad7e14c3578d8e0973b1e25f1aa4fc6c4846212`.

Literal root cause:
`.search-box__popup { display:grid; }` overrode the browser's closed Popover
`display:none`, leaving a transparent fixed hit box after visual closure.

Root-cause fix:
- `5c0562a58eb7c28a21ced50bbfe8964779ad9cc6`.

Current law:
- base popup rule does not set `display`;
- `display:grid` exists only in `:popover-open`;
- leaving popup is inert/noninteractive and releases the native top layer
  immediately.

### 5. Unified Input validation architecture — implemented

Authoritative contract:
`src/app/controls/INPUT_VALIDATION_CONTRACT_V1.md`.

Major implementation checkpoint:
- `c3971739198e61adff98d821a6b8f6775faa4e6c`.

Common semantic states:
`null | empty | no-selection | invalid-entry | valid-entry`.

Every CVA input participates in:
- `inputState`;
- `valid`;
- string `errors`;
- structured `validationIssues`;
- canonical validation snapshot;
- common `required`;
- Angular `NG_VALIDATORS` bridge;
- external/business validation hook.

Core law:
- character/domain admission is separate from value validation;
- invalid admitted drafts remain visible;
- validation does not silently clamp/erase a draft merely to pass;
- typed domain restrictions remain control-specific.

Expanded implementation also covered:
- default Field clearability with opt-out;
- URL/Tel domain handling;
- numeric/money/stepper validation;
- RangeSlider shared coordinate domain + moving value Tooltip;
- Time/DateTime Now reveal;
- inclusive rolling DateRange 7/30-day presets;
- fixed per-instance ColorPicker mode;
- ItemPicker vs ComboBox product distinction;
- File/Image selection validation.

### 6. Verification-hardening stage after expanded Inputs implementation

The canonical gate is always:
`npm run verify:clean`.

Substantive corrections encountered during the verification loop included:
- SearchBox native maxlength made validation-only:
  `28829cb6b581d741170a7dd24c677f5a8dac11f7`;
- InputBase intentional-unused-parameter lint correction:
  `e933a4b598c32cea949d61aaf31cb207c54e4b10`;
- Selection free-color contract + Temporal test compile gaps:
  `9b499753bb06d350513a2f0bbad0a5de84a2817d`;
- stale Inputs spec expectations aligned with approved contracts:
  `1a6b29c1aa5dca36474c10eb40ef64492a65e595`;
- final stale NumberBox/Overlay expected values:
  `c096afc3cda1d076cfc702c721427c8468e4c61b`.

This stage produced the earlier Fully Green checkpoint:
- 87/87 test files;
- 649/649 tests;
- app/spec typecheck PASS;
- zero-warning production build PASS.

### 7. Product Owner runtime findings after that green checkpoint

The Product Owner then found three concrete runtime issues:
- Ghost/Text/Underline hover visible in Dark but effectively absent in Light;
- typed character admission had become too permissive for specialized controls;
- shared picker Clear actions needed IconButton + Tooltip presentation.

Bounded implementation checkpoints included:
- `e7068b64df5b64b789dbc4d2b5f81648ad11d2e9`
  typed character admission restoration;
- `b54c89c621dab914dda3555a5f8cf7ac0a48fd37`
  Overlay Clear as icon + Tooltip;
- `fead82d36c30533e575ab34ff41463f19ffa6848`
  regression tests/governance;
- `cade8015624c804d0be83bad5d2c49f126f5b906`
  Overlay Clear governance;
- `488741922c365a605acc9a70141f600278c46087`
  patch-integrity repair;
- `65c097d224bb31f282ec5737ebc8381ed9f73b14`
  icon-only Clear contract lock.

Follow-up governance/parser and stale-test corrections:
- `0dfea6b1eb71441267165da3149a0148ea6c4ade`;
- `c096afc3cda1d076cfc702c721427c8468e4c61b`.

### 8. Latest Product Owner runtime findings — URL, Solid, NumberBox, motion, live data

Latest authorized findings:
1. UrlBox must accept real web domains with optional HTTP(S) scheme and reject
   incomplete hosts such as `http://www.s`.
2. Solid needs the same Light/Dark hover discoverability guarantee as
   Ghost/Text/Underline.
3. NumberBox editing must admit ASCII digits only; min/max/step remain
   validation concerns.
4. selected File/Image rows need subtle hover/focus scale motion.
5. SearchBox, ItemPicker, and ComboBox result/item collections must be
   runtime-dynamic production data, including while an overlay is already open.

Implementation/test/governance checkpoints:
- `9b13eab3c00046a3ed6258d981d33663355b26e0`;
- `2912b97cb62ea159430bdca3f386814fa914698c`;
- `98c3c8ccddc8812af57d8b6a429b9510e0151465`;
- `5ec8124cb8ad483309d525bf558d41abb4252669`;
- `b6974154a916ebb751eda5290c7bbc2a9bce704b`;
- `eb3db0130db1786488b91e050f9d54168b28bbd3`;
- `64edf72fe8c7655a98e52d98e910bf675629129b`;
- `9ffa59e348b6246f1c8a210c01d437763b3a1f65`;
- URL-regex lint-only correction:
  `9315691c9579a324990a56d928e4e22d504111a4`.

Current detailed laws:
- UrlBox accepts scheme-less or HTTP(S) real domains with valid multi-label
  hostnames/TLDs and reports `url.format` for incomplete domains;
- Solid/Ghost/Text/Underline use the same theme-sensitive hover-token law;
- NumberBox editor is digits-only while admitted values may still be invalid
  through min/max/step;
- File/Image selected rows use tokenized `scale(1.01)` hover/focus motion and
  reduced-motion cancellation;
- SearchBox dropdown is signal-live; SearchBox modal, ItemPicker, and ComboBox
  use a live items provider while open;
- production controls are governed against Design-Lab/review-internal
  dependencies.

### 9. Current canonical technical checkpoint

Product Owner verified current source with:
`npm run verify:clean`.

Latest verified result:
- all governance checks PASS;
- Angular lint PASS;
- 87/87 test files PASS;
- **653/653 tests PASS**;
- `typecheck:app` PASS;
- `typecheck:spec` PASS;
- production build PASS;
- `Zero-warning build gate: PASS`.

Inputs status:
**Technical PASS / Product Owner runtime review still authoritative**.
Technical green never substitutes for Product Owner visual/runtime acceptance.

### 10. Mandatory continuity discipline

The following four files form the mandatory continuity quartet and must all be
updated in the same work cycle whenever a substantive decision, finding,
implementation state, blocker, verification result, or next gate changes:

- `src/app/controls/CONTROLS_EXECUTION_ROADMAP_V1.md`;
- `src/app/controls/INPUTS_PRODUCT_OWNER_REVIEW_FINDINGS_V1.md`;
- `README_FIRST.md`;
- `NEW_CHAT_HANDOFF.md`.

Do not treat an update to only one or two of these as a complete continuity
sync.
<!-- CHATGPT_PROJECT_HISTORY_DIGEST_END -->


<!-- CHATGPT_OVERLAY_RUNTIME_REVIEW_2026_10_01_START -->
## 2026-10-01 — Product Owner Overlay runtime review: bounded correction implemented / verification pending

Product Owner reviewed `/controls/overlays` in Light/Dark and identified five
Overlay-specific corrections.

### Authorized findings

1. The dedicated Overlay review page must contain Overlay-system evidence only.
   Temporal Inputs, selection pickers, and deferred control composites were
   duplicated there despite already having their production review locations.

2. The separator below the shared Overlay Header and above the Footer was
   visible in Light but too weak in Dark.

3. Default modal enter/exit motion must be `flip-x`.

4. Drawer positions must support all four edges:
   - logical start;
   - logical end;
   - physical top;
   - physical bottom.

5. Full-height side drawers must keep the shared Footer at the bottom/end of the
   surface while Body owns the flexible scrolling region.

### Bounded implementation

Source checkpoint:
`2a1d33ca9461de00ceec74f0d7ad5b69f0b38ae7`
(`fix(overlays): clean showcase and complete drawer geometry`).

Implemented:
- `ErpOverlayPosition` now includes `top`;
- default modal motion is `flip-x / flip-x`;
- top drawer defaults to `slide-down / slide-up`;
- existing start/end and bottom drawer defaults remain intact;
- OverlayHost positions top drawers at the top and gives top/bottom drawers full
  inline size;
- `ErpOverlayFrame` host + frame fill available full-height drawer surfaces;
- Header stays at start, Footer stays at bottom/end, Body uses the flexible
  scrolling grid row;
- new `--honesty-overlay-frame-separator-color` maps to
  `--honesty-border-default` and feeds both Header-bottom and Footer-top
  separator borders for Light/Dark visibility;
- `/controls/overlays` now has only four review groups:
  Modal, Drawers, Nested stack, and dismissal/backdrop/blur/motion policies;
- repeated Date/Time/DateRange, selection picker, RadioGroup/ButtonGroup,
  SplitButton, and FabMenu showcase evidence was removed from this route;
- top-drawer review evidence was added.

Test checkpoint:
`11532bd6d1589eaab43a012ce687f7be923cae61`
(`test(overlays): cover overlay-only page and four drawer edges`).

Governance/documentation checkpoint:
`f5e1d7ebcb79c4f76e98b918380843d877f6edec`
(`chore(overlays): govern top drawer and overlay-only review`).

Governance now protects:
- exact Overlay position union including top;
- `flip-x` modal default;
- top drawer geometry/motion;
- Overlay separator token;
- full-height Header/Body/Footer frame law;
- Overlay-only review-page scope with no duplicated Input/control demos.

Pre-rerun checks:
- Overlay governance JavaScript syntax compilation PASS;
- complete Overlay governance internal self-test PASS.

### Current status

**Implemented / canonical verification pending.**

Mandatory next gate:
`npm run verify:clean`.

The previous 87/87 files / 653/653 tests Fully Green checkpoint predates this
Overlay correction and must not be applied to the new source until the full
canonical gate passes.

After technical green, Product Owner runtime review must confirm the five
findings above in Light and Dark.
<!-- CHATGPT_OVERLAY_RUNTIME_REVIEW_2026_10_01_END -->


<!-- CHATGPT_OVERLAY_SHOWCASE_OWNERSHIP_FOLLOWUP_START -->
## 2026-10-01 — Overlay-only page verification follow-up: public review ownership relocated

Product Owner pulled:
`bfbdc9d3d2d7cf70cc82511d0a075ea8ea0c03f2`
and ran the full canonical gate:
`npm run verify:clean`.

Observed progress:
- theme authority PASS;
- route-page ERP-only authoring PASS;
- Component Token framework PASS;
- system-color registry PASS;
- ErpText PASS;
- ErpIcon PASS;
- ErpButton PASS;
- ErpTooltip PASS;
- ErpField governance then stopped before ErpOverlay/ng lint.

Exact demonstrated cause:
`PROGRAM_PUBLIC_CONTROLS` in
`tools/controls/check-erp-field-governance.mjs` still mapped twelve public
controls to the old Overlay showcase even though Product Owner had explicitly
made `/controls/overlays` Overlay-only.

The stale ownership affected:
- DateBox / TimeBox / DateTimeBox / DateRangeBox;
- ColorPicker / IconPicker / ItemPicker / ComboBox;
- RadioGroup;
- ButtonGroup / SplitButton / FabMenu.

Bounded correction:
- temporal + selection picker review ownership maps to
  `src/app/showcase/input-controls/input-controls.html`;
- RadioGroup review evidence was relocated into the existing Inputs
  Boolean/Choice group;
- ButtonGroup / SplitButton / FabMenu review evidence was relocated into the
  Buttons showcase in one dedicated Button Composites group;
- ErpField inventory now maps those three button composites to the Buttons
  showcase;
- Overlay showcase remains free of all twelve controls and is not weakened by
  the governance correction.

Correction checkpoint:
`ae1d33d07bbb340690ba670a46553fc557f02d77`
(`fix(governance): relocate public control review ownership`).

Pre-rerun checks:
- ErpField governance JavaScript syntax PASS;
- complete ErpField governance internal self-test PASS;
- live HTML ownership audit:
  - all nine Input/selection controls present on Inputs;
  - all three button composites present on Buttons;
  - none of the twelve present on Overlays.

Current status:
**implemented / canonical verification pending**.

Mandatory next gate:
`npm run verify:clean`.

Do not restore duplicated controls to the Overlay page to satisfy inventory.
Review ownership must remain aligned to the control's actual production-review
page.
<!-- CHATGPT_OVERLAY_SHOWCASE_OWNERSHIP_FOLLOWUP_END -->


<!-- CHATGPT_BUTTON_SHOWCASE_ICON_FOLLOWUP_2026_10_02_START -->
## 2026-10-02 — verification follow-up: invalid Button showcase icon corrected

Product Owner pulled:
`c02dd33d32dfdcb2ec3029a11f578584b1b2dca8`
and reran:
`npm run verify:clean`.

Observed progress:
- all foundation/governance checks PASS;
- ErpField governance PASS;
- ErpOverlay governance PASS;
- Angular lint PASS;
- test bundle generation then stopped before test execution on one TypeScript
  template/compiler error.

Exact demonstrated failure:
`src/app/showcase/button-controls/button-controls.ts:98`

The newly relocated SplitButton/FabMenu showcase data used
`icon: 'table'`, but `table` is not an `ErpIconName` in the current
semantic registry.

Bounded correction:
- `619c5b3c3f0850567524d9c386a469fb18ac31de`
  `fix(showcase): use registered export icon`;
- replace only the invalid showcase icon `table` with registered semantic
  `download`;
- no production Button, SplitButton, FabMenu, Overlay, or Input runtime behavior
  changed.

Current status:
**implemented / canonical verification pending**.

Mandatory next gate:
`npm run verify:clean`.

Do not reopen the Overlay page ownership decision. Inputs/selection evidence
remains on Inputs, button composites remain on Buttons, and Overlays remains
Overlay-only.
<!-- CHATGPT_BUTTON_SHOWCASE_ICON_FOLLOWUP_2026_10_02_END -->


<!-- CHATGPT_RADIOGROUP_SHOWCASE_TEST_FOLLOWUP_2026_10_02_START -->
## 2026-10-02 — verification follow-up: nested RadioGroup showcase count corrected

Product Owner reran the complete canonical gate after relocating public control
review ownership to Inputs / Buttons while keeping Overlays Overlay-only.

Observed result:
- all governance checks PASS;
- Angular lint PASS;
- test bundle generation PASS;
- Overlay showcase PASS;
- Button showcase PASS;
- Overlay host/frame/manager tests PASS;
- 86/87 test files PASS;
- 650/651 tests PASS;
- exactly one test failed in
  `src/app/showcase/input-controls/input-controls.spec.ts`.

Demonstrated cause:
- the Boolean/Choice showcase now contains four standalone `ErpRadioBox`
  controls plus one `ErpRadioGroup`;
- `ErpRadioGroup` correctly renders three internal `ErpRadioBox` children;
- the stale showcase test used
  `querySelectorAll('erp-radio-box').length === 4`, which counted both
  standalone and grouped RadioBoxes and therefore received 7.

Bounded correction:
- `9c56954e62231a29966ed78abb1662c8ef3c8124`
  `fix(test): distinguish standalone and grouped radios`;
- no production source changed;
- the test now explicitly asserts:
  - four standalone RadioBoxes outside any RadioGroup;
  - three RadioBoxes owned by the RadioGroup;
  - one RadioGroup review instance.

This keeps the relocated review ownership intact and tests the component
composition instead of flattening nested DOM ownership.

Current status:
**implemented / canonical verification pending**.

Mandatory next gate:
`npm run verify:clean`.

Do not move RadioGroup back to the Overlay page and do not weaken public-control
inventory governance.
